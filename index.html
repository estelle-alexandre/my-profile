				<p>I plan on continuing my studies as long as I can to discover the business world in its entirety. After my bachelor degree, I'd like to do a Master 2 in marketing of the luxury. My project for now would be to work abroad, to combine my passion for travels and business.</p>

			<h2>My hobbies 🤹‍♀️</h2>
				<h3>CAPOEIRA 🤸‍♀️</h3>
					<p>I practice Capoeira since I'm 5 years old, I have now the Grey Rope and I'm really proud!</p>
				<h3>YOGA 🧘</h3>
					<p>I began Yoga recently, last year actually, but I really love it! It's a prefect way to relax and focus on your goals.</p>
				<h3>READING 📖</h3>
					<p>I've always loved to read. My favorite type of books is "youth romance" and my guilty pleasure is to read outside under the sun 🌞</p>

			<h2>My travels 🌎</h2>
				<h3>PORTUGAL 🇵🇹</h3>
					<p>I'm Portuguese so I often go to Portugal. I've done a lot of cities but my favorite one is still Lisbon.</p>
				<h3>UK 🇬🇧</h3>
					<p>I went to London in 2016. It was a quick trip but I loved it : I practiced a lot my English skills.</p>
				<h3>USA 🇺🇸</h3>
					<p>I did a bit of different cities of the East Coast (including NYC and Washington). It was really hot, because I went there in August. Personnally, I've prefered Washington against NYC.</p>
				<h3>SWEDEN 🇸🇪</h3>
					<p>It was my first trip without parents! I loved this cute country even if it was cold. I went to Stockholm and I was with my swedish bestfriend so I had a really good guide by my side.</p>
				<h3>CROATIA 🇭🇷</h3>
					<p>My 18 year old trip! This trip suprised me because I wasn't expecting such a beautiful place.</p>

				<p>AND HOPING MANY MORE TRAVELS TO COME... ✨</p>
